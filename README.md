# Art & Photography Website

Website written in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (Node.js) with D3.

This was written as part of my university course on web technologies. Included is:

- A full, polished website written using the Twitter Bootstrap framework.
- Frontend JavaScript to create scrolling panoramas, animations and modals.
- Backend JavaScript to create an automatic emailing system.
- A data gathering service written in JavaScript attached to a MySQL backend with a D3 front end for viewing the data.

Feel free to build and run it, and get in contact with any questions!

Best,


James.
